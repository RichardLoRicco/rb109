We started working on a card game but got stuck. Check out why the code below raises a TypeError.

Once you get the program to run and produce a sum, you might notice that the sum is off: It's lower than it should be. Why is that?

=end
# cards = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, :jack, :queen, :king, :ace]

# deck = { :hearts   => cards,
#          :diamonds => cards,
#          :clubs    => cards,
#          :spades   => cards }

# def score(card)
#   case card
#   when :ace   then 11
#   when :king  then 10
#   when :queen then 10
#   when :jack  then 10
#   else card
#   end
# end

# # Pick one random card per suit

# player_cards = []
# deck.keys.each do |suit|
#   cards = deck[suit]
#   cards.shuffle!
#   player_cards << cards.pop
# end

# # Determine the score of the remaining cards in the deck

# sum = deck.reduce(0) do |sum, (_, remaining_cards)|
#   remaining_cards.map do |card|
#     score(card)
#   end

#   sum += remaining_cards.sum
# end

# puts sum

Solution:

We get a TypeError on line 40 because we did not assign and therefore use the return value of the Array#map method on line 26. Therefore, when
we try to sum the card scores on line 40, we are trying to add :jack, :queen, etc. instead of their score.
