Write a method that takes an Array, and returns a new Array with the elements of the original list in reverse order.
Do not modify the original list.

You may not use Array#reverse or Array#reverse!, nor may you use the method you wrote in the previous exercise.

Examples:
reverse([1,2,3,4]) == [4,3,2,1]          # => true
reverse(%w(a b e d c)) == %w(c d e b a)  # => true
reverse(['abc']) == ['abc']              # => true
reverse([]) == []                        # => true

list = [1, 3, 2]                      # => [1, 3, 2]
new_list = reverse(list)              # => [2, 3, 1]
list.object_id != new_list.object_id  # => true
list == [1, 3, 2]                     # => true
new_list == [2, 3, 1]                 # => true


algorithm:
same as last problem, but return reversed_arr

def reverse(arr)
  reversed_arr = []
  arr.each do |element|
    reversed_arr.unshift(element)
  end
  
  reversed_arr
end


# Test Cases:
p reverse([1,2,3,4]) == [4,3,2,1]          # => true
p reverse(%w(a b e d c)) == %w(c d e b a)  # => true
p reverse(['abc']) == ['abc']              # => true
p reverse([]) == []                        # => true

list = [1, 3, 2]                      # => [1, 3, 2]
new_list = reverse(list)              # => [2, 3, 1]
p list.object_id != new_list.object_id  # => true
p list == [1, 3, 2]                     # => true
p new_list == [2, 3, 1]                 # => true
